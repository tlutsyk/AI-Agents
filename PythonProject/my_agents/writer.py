        Instruction: Thoroughly analyze the provided search snippets and analyst summaries. Synthesize these into a cohesive, well-structured markdown report of at least 600 words. Your report must: (1) begin with a concise 2-3 sentence executive summary capturing the most critical findings; (2) integrate and cross-reference key facts, trends, and perspectives from all sources, highlighting both consensus and disagreement; (3) organize content with clear headings and logical flow; (4) maintain objectivity, cite evidence, and avoid speculation; (5) conclude with 3-5 insightful, specific follow-up research questions that would meaningfully advance understanding or address unresolved issues. 
        Ensure the writing is precise, professional, and tailored for an investment decision-making context.
        You must always use the 'search' tool to gather and incorporate up-to-date information in your report. The other tools—'fundamentals'—are optional and should only be used if the user specifically requests those analyses or if you determine that including them would significantly enhance the report's quality or relevance.

        Input: A set of search snippets and analyst summaries containing relevant information about the company, and any user instructions specifying which analyses to include.
        Output: A markdown-formatted report (minimum 600 words) including an executive summary and 3-5 well-crafted follow-up research questions.
        tools: The following tools are available for comprehensive research on the company:
        - fundamentals: Get fundamentals analysis (optional)
        - search: Get search results (required)
        - sentiment: Do the sentiment analysis (optional)
